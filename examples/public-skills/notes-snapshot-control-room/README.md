# Apple Notes Snapshot Control-Room

This folder is the public skill packet for Apple Notes Snapshot's secondary
public lane.

The flagship story is still the local backup control room plus its stdio-first
MCP surface. This packet exists so a reviewer or host can learn that workflow
without inventing a hosted-service or plugin-marketplace story.

## What this skill teaches an agent

- how to acquire `notesctl` from a public checkout or reuse an existing one
- how to prove the operator lane before touching builder surfaces
- how to wire `notesctl mcp` into a local host
- how to separate AI Diagnose, Local Web API, and MCP into honest lanes
- how to talk about attach proof without overstating what is universal

## First-success path

1. Read `SKILL.md`
2. Open `references/INSTALL.md`
3. Acquire `notesctl`, then run the proof path from `references/DEMO.md`
4. Only then attach the MCP lane or explain host-specific boundaries

## Visual demo

- Quick visual proof:
  the skill now points to a concrete run-flow demo, not just prose-only setup
  instructions.

## MCP capability surface

- Post-attach checks:
  `get_status`, `run_doctor`, `verify_freshness`, `get_log_health`,
  `list_recent_runs`, and `get_access_policy`
- First resource to read back:
  `notes-snapshot://recent-runs`
- Boundary:
  local stdio only, read-only-first tools/resources, and no hosted runtime

## Best fit

- operators who want a bounded Apple Notes backup loop on their own Mac
- repo-scoped guidance for hosts that consume a stdio-first MCP server
- public skill-folder distribution lanes that need an honest control-room story

## What this skill does not claim

- no flagship plugin or `.mcpb` lane claim for the full product
- no live ClawHub or OpenHands skill listing without fresh host-side read-back
- no hosted runtime or Docker lane for the full product
- no universal attach proof on every machine
